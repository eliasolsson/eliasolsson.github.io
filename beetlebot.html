										<p><b>About:</b> BEETLEBOT is a singleplayer third person shooter in which the player takes control of a mechanical beetle built to exterminate ants. Starting from top of the anthill and descending down the colony, it will kill every ant in sight, with the end goal of killing the Ant Queen.</p>

												<h3>▶ Contribution Breakdown</h3>
											</header>
											<p><b>1. Researched and sketched level designs and concepts based on ant colonies.</b></p>
											<p>The level design process for BEETLEBOT was done with two other designers and the idea was to get as many ideas, concepts and blockouts done as possible while the programmers were busy building the base of the game. It was done in a in-house engine so remote sharing wasn't possible. I began to personally look into ant colony diagrams and layouts and got a few ideas of that, especially with our gameplay in mind. I would come up with a few dozen concepts, some favouring gameplay more than the realism of ant architecture mainly because a lot of ant colonies are built in a very similar way.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>2. Designed and gave feedback on other level sections designed.</b></p>
											<p>Blockouts began shortly after the first concepts were thought of and continued consistenly for the first weeks, using Tensor a level editor part of Tengine. All us three designers eventually sat down and narrowed all the blockouts down to three levels and a boss room. One of my blockouts made it in and some elements of other blockouts were merged in to achieve the best of both worlds.</p>

											<p><i>Figures 1, 2 and 3. Blockouts for several of the level concepts made in Tensor, the level editor for Tengine. Figure 1 made into the game with major adjustments, the image at the top of the page shows the level in the final build of the game.</i></p>
											<br>
											<p><b>3. Refined difficulty and overall balance in the game.</b></p>
											<p>In the final days of the project, I would go on to refine the diffculty properly for the game as a lot of the numbers prior were used mainly for testing and development purposes. This included wave numbers and enemy numbers, including cooldowns and damage values for the beetle's arsenal. The enemy and wave total slowly scaled up across the game in an even fashion, while XP gain was changed over and over until the upgrades matched the progression in a way we wanted. The grenade was powerful so a decent cooldown had to be given to balance it out.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>4. Helped implement and tune screen shake in several aspects.</b></p>
											<p>I assisted programmer Edvin with fine-tuning and implementing screen shake in a majority of aspects in the gameplay. Like firing the beetle's weapons, impact of grenades, taking damage and so forth. A big priority was ensuring it did not cause motion sickness, while still adding that nice visual flair.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>5. Assisting with sound design by finding, implementing and tweaking volumes of certain sound effects.</b></p>
											<p>I assisted designer Sebastian with sound design. He focused a lot on creating, mixing and implementing the sounds. What I did was find tons of reference sounds that he could then edit and mix further, I also assisted further with implementation and did a lot of volume tweaking within the game itself, ensuring no sound was too sharp or weak. Some examples of reference sounds includes when the BEETLE was out of cooldown and has to reload and upgrade noise.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>6. Playtesting to report critical issues and flaws.</b></p>
											<p>Playtesting was something the entire team did consistently. During the final few days, I started to playtest very often and was usually the guinea pig for any new changes/fixes the programmers rolled out. Reported several crashes especially during the level loading process, which were fixed in the last few hours of the project. It also led to me myself adjusting spawn and teleport points in the levels to fix some issues as well.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>7. Wrote the credits.</b></p>
											<p>I recieved the task during the final week of development to gather the contributions of everyone and write the credits, which was then sent to fellow artist Fanny who would turn into proper looking credits. The process went smoothly, but I made sure to review constantly with the team to make sure no one felt under represented in the credits. I also took some time to threw in a few inside joke credits as well. All in good fun! I am very satisfied with the end product.</p>
