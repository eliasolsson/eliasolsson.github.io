										<p><b>About:</b> A collection of seven Mann vs. Machine (PvE) custom maps for Team Fortress 2. They were made between 2015 and 2017 alongside 2025 (following an update announcement by the game's developers) with the help of many talented individuals. All maps have their own distinctive themes and different contributors.</p>

												<h3>▶ Contribution Breakdown</h3>
											</header>
											<p><b>1. Creating several missions (via .pop files) for all maps, providing a rich gameplay experience.</b></p>
											<p>Missions are required for a Mann vs. Machine map to function, it's the gameplay. It consists of waves, with each one having a certain amount of robots. I made atleast one of these for every map. All five maps had their own unique robots to make them stand out, but a lot of these were inspired by Valve's official missions for their official maps. We wanted to be equal and even surpass where we could, so lots of efforts and tests were made to ensure these played nicely.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>2. Refined my own and other contributors missions to achieve a level of consistency across them.</b></p>
											<p>One thing I did a lot was to go through all of the missions/.pop files for a map and polish them immensly. Some examples of refining/polishing to me was giving these missions a similar formatting, naming schemes, ensuring all robot types behave consistenly across the missions and are also used equally.</p>
											<br>
											<p><b>3. Tested, organized playtests and forwarded any feedback to the relevant map creators.</b></p>
											<p>I organized several playtests during these years, and gathered lots of feetback. Seriously. Every map and mission probably had atleast 50-100+ playtests each, with full teams of six people across different continents. I had a Steam Group with thousands of members, so filling a server for a test was not really a problem lot of the time. Tons of changes to the missions and maps occured as a result. I always consider it a good thing to get an external view from other people.</p>
